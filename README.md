## Project Description:
This will be a project that will display covid - 19 data and statistics, it will also give an about page and ways to avoid it. 
The way it will be set up is there will be a home page with a nav bar that will take you home, to the about covid, and a page
that shows you how to avoid it.

## Working API 
The api I will be using in this project is this one right [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc?version=latest#intro)
I have tested it in postman and it does recieve the data I was hoping to get for it. I will try to implement a map maybe to show where it is the most active but I don't know if I'll be able to make that happen. 

## Screenshots
Here I will upload progress of the website as I go.
