## Project Description:

This will be a project that will display covid - 19 data and statistics, it will also give an about page and ways to avoid it.
The way it will be set up is there will be a home page with a nav bar that will take you home, to the about covid, and a page
that shows you how to avoid it.

## Working API

The api's I will be using in this project are this one right [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc?version=latest#intro) and this [one](https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?q=COVID&from=2020-03-16&sortBy=publishedAt&apiKey=93d0380b616c44ee82169a2f0fbe3cb1&pageSize=10&page=2)
I have tested it in postman and it does recieve the data I was hoping to get for it. I will try to implement a map maybe to show where it is the most active but I don't know if I'll be able to make that happen.

## Screenshots

Here I will upload progress of the website as I go.
